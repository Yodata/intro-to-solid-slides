### Contributing

The slide deck is made using the [Remark.js](http://remarkjs.com/) framework.
It consists of a single html file, [`index.html`](index.html), which contains
slides in Markdown format, separated by `---`.

It's intended for both online (at github.io) and offline usage (hence a local
commit of the `remark-latest.min.js` source code).

To preview your changes locally:

```bash
