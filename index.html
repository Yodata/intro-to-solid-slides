# Introduction to Solid

**So**cial **Li**nked **D**ata

---

## Solid is...

1. A continuation of the vision of the Read-Write Web
2. A toolkit for Linked Data enabled social apps
3. A testbed for decentralized research

---

## The Read-Write Web

A standardized way of Reading and Writing data.

The first ever web browser (Tim's WorldWideWeb) could read and ***edit*** pages.

As web grew, it became *read only* for most users.

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

---

## The "Read" part of Read-Write Web

Well, sort of...

![Incompatible Auth](incompat_auth.jpg)

Authentication/authorization compatibility still an issue. (Recurring theme.)

---

## The "Write" part of Read-Write Web

It's 2016. What is the state of the art as far as:

*Writing* data on the web? (Generic, inter-operable)

(Out of scope: non-web methods such as SFTP, SSH, SMB, etc)

---

### HTTP POST (Form submit / File upload)

![Form submit](form_submit.png)

* Not very feature rich
* One-off / hand rolled implementations on the server slide

---

### WebDAV (RFC 4918)

![WebDAV](webdav.gif)

**Web D**istributed **A**uthoring and **V**ersioning

* Started around 1999 (finalized in 2007)
* File transfer, collaboration (a more "webby" FTP)
* Mount remote WebDAV file systems in most OSs

---

### WebDAV

HTTP verbs (GET / POST/ PUT / DELETE) plus extensions:
- Collections (create / list directories)
- Concurrency control (lock/unlock)
- Copy / Move
- Properties per resource, in XML. (PropFind/PropPatch)
- Auth: Username+Password, group-based ACLs

Useful for file transfer. **Not decentralized.**

---

### AtomPub and co

**Atom:** XML-based format for *web feeds* (successor to RSS).

**AtomPub:** A way to read/write/manage Atom feeds.
- Complex on the server-side. Not easy on client side.

**OData:** Open Data Protocol. Initially by Microsoft, now by OASIS.
- Extension of AtomPub
- Very complex on server side (especially data model)
- *General-purpose querying syntax*
- See also: competing GData (Google Data) protocol

Complex. **Not decentralized.**

---

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

* Millions of (slightly incompatible) APIs
* Familiar to most developers
* Great framework support (Ruby on Rails, etc)
* No standardized auth (OAuth2 and OpenID Connect as state of the art)
* No standard data model definition. Though see:
  [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/),
  [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html),
  [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)
* No standard querying syntax (though see Facebook's GraphQL)

---

## Read-Write Web: What have we learned?

1. (decentralized) Auth* is hard
2. (general-purpose) Querying is hard
3. (general-purpose) Data definition is hard

Easy to do a one-off REST service. Interop - nearly impossible.

**We can do better.**

---

## Solid: Easier Read/Write Web

REST API + Linked Data.

* Simple persistence for your linked data (datasets, images, etc)
* "Webization" of the File System: Containers (folders) + Resources (files)
* HTTP verbs: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE / **PATCH**
* Decentralized Identity, Authentication and Access Control
